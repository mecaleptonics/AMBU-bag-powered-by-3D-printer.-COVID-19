# AMBU-bag-powered-by-3D-printer.-COVID-19
we will use a 3D printer to activate the manual artificial resuscitator better known as AMBU BAG.   This allows us to use a mechanism we have available and focus on developing code, software, and mounting or   manufacturing sensors, valves, and filters for scalable performance. There are several options for performing this task. Directly from programs that control the printer such as   Replicator, pronterface, etc. It is worth saying that From the PC you can also go to micropython, since pronterface is based on this software. However, in order to expand the possibilities of many and improve the software, we will use an arduino (Italy!).  This also allows software developers to work their code on something practical, without dwelling on the   mechanical part.
